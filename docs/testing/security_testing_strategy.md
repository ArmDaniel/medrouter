# Security Testing Strategy

## 1. Objective

The objective of security testing for MedRouter is to identify and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of patient data and the application itself. This strategy aims to proactively address security risks in compliance with healthcare regulations like HIPAA and GDPR.

## 2. Scope

Security testing will cover all critical components of the MedRouter application, including:

*   Frontend application (React.js)
*   Backend API (Node.js/Express.js)
*   Database (PostgreSQL)
*   Authentication and authorization mechanisms (JWT, RBAC)
*   Data handling processes (input, storage, processing, output)
*   LLM service integrations (data sent to/received from LLMs, though LLMs themselves are external)
*   File upload and storage mechanisms.

## 3. Key Security Areas and Test Scenarios

### 3.1. Authentication
*   **Objective**: Ensure only legitimate users can access the system.
*   **Test Scenarios**:
    *   **TC-AUTH-001**: Verify JWT generation upon successful login with correct credentials.
    *   **TC-AUTH-002**: Verify JWT validation for protected API endpoints; invalid or expired tokens should be rejected.
    *   **TC-AUTH-003**: Test token expiry and the refresh token mechanism (if fully implemented and used).
    *   **TC-AUTH-004**: Verify secure password hashing (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) and storage (no plain-text passwords).
    *   **TC-AUTH-005**: Test password complexity rules and secure password reset functionality (if implemented).
    *   **TC-AUTH-006**: Test against common authentication attacks:
        *   Brute-force login attempts (check for rate limiting or account lockout - future enhancement).
        *   Credential stuffing (if applicable).
        *   Token hijacking (ensure tokens are not easily exposed, e.g., via XSS).
    *   **TC-AUTH-007**: Verify secure logout (client-side token removal, server-side token invalidation if implemented).

### 3.2. Authorization (Role-Based Access Control - RBAC)
*   **Objective**: Ensure users can only access resources and perform actions appropriate to their roles.
*   **Test Scenarios**:
    *   **TC-AZ-001 (Patient Role)**:
        *   Verify Patient can create cases, view their own cases/reports/chat.
        *   Verify Patient *cannot* access other patients' data, doctor dashboards, or admin functionalities.
        *   Verify Patient *cannot* trigger LLM processing or generate doctor reports directly.
    *   **TC-AZ-002 (Doctor Role)**:
        *   Verify Doctor can view assigned cases, trigger data processing, generate reports for assigned cases, participate in chat for assigned cases.
        *   Verify Doctor *cannot* access cases not assigned to them (unless a "pool" or "admin" view allows, which is not current design).
        *   Verify Doctor *cannot* perform patient-specific registration actions beyond their own profile.
    *   **TC-AZ-003 (Endpoint Access)**: For every API endpoint, verify that it correctly enforces role permissions defined by `protect` and `authorize` middleware. Attempt access with unauthorized roles.
    *   **TC-AZ-004 (IDOR - Insecure Direct Object References)**: Test if a user can access/modify resources belonging to another user by manipulating IDs in URLs or API requests (e.g., changing `caseId` in a request).

### 3.3. Data Protection & Input Validation
*   **Objective**: Protect data from unauthorized disclosure, modification, and ensure data integrity.
*   **Test Scenarios**:
    *   **TC-DP-001 (Input Validation - API)**: Test all API endpoints that accept input data (body, params, query) for resilience against:
        *   Common injection attacks (e.g., NoSQL injection if MongoDB were used, general command injection if inputs are used in system commands - less likely here). For PostgreSQL, parameterized queries are key.
        *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) payloads in data that might be rendered on frontend (ensure proper output encoding/sanitization).
    *   **TC-DP-002 (Input Validation - Frontend)**: Test all forms for client-side validation (as a UX enhancement) and ensure backend performs authoritative validation.
    *   **TC-DP-003 (File Upload Security - *Pending full backend implementation*)**:
        *   Test file type restrictions (e.g., allow only specific image types or PDF).
        *   Test file size limits.
        *   Test for malicious file uploads (e.g., files with embedded scripts, if they are ever rendered insecurely).
        *   Test for path traversal if filenames are used in filesystem operations.
    *   **TC-DP-004 (Data Exposure)**: Review API responses to ensure no sensitive data (e.g., other users' PII, system configuration, full error stacks in production) is unintentionally exposed.
    *   **TC-DP-005 (Encryption)**:
        *   Verify data in transit is encrypted (HTTPS/TLS for all communication - requires deployment context).
        *   Verify sensitive data at rest is encrypted in the database (requires DB-level checks).
    *   **TC-DP-006 (Error Handling)**: Ensure error messages do not reveal sensitive system information.

### 3.4. API Security (General)
*   **Objective**: Ensure overall API robustness.
*   **Test Scenarios**:
    *   **TC-API-001 (Secure Headers)**: Check for presence of security-enhancing HTTP headers (e.g., Content-Security-Policy, X-Content-Type-Options, Strict-Transport-Security - typically set by web server/gateway).
    *   **TC-API-002 (Rate Limiting - *Future Enhancement*)**: Test if excessive requests to APIs are throttled to prevent abuse.
    *   **TC-API-003 (HTTP Method Tampering)**: Ensure endpoints only respond to appropriate HTTP verbs (e.g., a GET endpoint should not accept POST).

### 3.5. Client-Side Security
*   **Objective**: Secure the frontend application.
*   **Test Scenarios**:
    *   **TC-CLI-001 (Token Storage)**: Verify JWTs are stored securely (e.g., `localStorage` is common but susceptible to XSS; HttpOnly cookies for refresh tokens are better for web but add complexity). Review current `localStorage` usage.
    *   **TC-CLI-002 (XSS Prevention)**: Ensure user-supplied data rendered on pages is properly sanitized/encoded (React generally handles this well for direct data binding, but be cautious with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` or direct DOM manipulation).
    *   **TC-CLI-003 (Dependency Vulnerabilities)**: Regularly run `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to check for known vulnerabilities in frontend dependencies.

## 4. Testing Tools and Techniques

*   **Manual Penetration Testing**: Simulate attacker behavior by manually probing for vulnerabilities in forms, API endpoints, and application logic.
*   **Automated Security Scanners**:
    *   **OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy)** or **Burp Suite (Community Edition)**: For dynamic application security testing (DAST) of the web application and APIs.
    *   **npm audit / yarn audit**: For identifying vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
    *   Linters with security plugins (e.g., ESLint security plugins).
*   **Code Reviews**: Perform security-focused code reviews, looking for common vulnerability patterns and adherence to secure coding practices.
*   **Threat Modeling**: (Done earlier in design, but can inform testing) Identify potential threats and attack vectors to prioritize testing efforts.

## 5. Compliance Considerations (HIPAA/GDPR)

*   Testing should verify that implemented controls supporting HIPAA/GDPR are effective. This includes:
    *   **Access Controls**: As tested under RBAC.
    *   **Audit Trails**: Verify that security-relevant events (logins, data access, changes) are logged (requires backend implementation of audit logging).
    *   **Data Minimization**: Check that only necessary data is collected and processed.
    *   **Encryption**: As tested under Data Protection.

## 6. Reporting

*   Detailed reports for each identified vulnerability, including:
    *   Description and location of the vulnerability.
    *   Steps to reproduce.
    *   Potential impact.
    *   Recommended mitigation.
*   Severity rating for each vulnerability (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low).
*   Summary report of overall security posture.

This strategy document will be a living document and should be updated as the application architecture and features evolve.
