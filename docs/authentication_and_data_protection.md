# Authentication and Data Protection

This document details the authentication mechanisms and data protection strategies for the MedRouter application to ensure security and compliance with regulations like HIPAA and GDPR.

## Authentication

### 1. Method: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

MedRouter will use JWT-based authentication. This is a stateless, token-based authentication mechanism widely used in modern web applications.

*   **Login**:
    *   Users (Patients and Doctors) will register and log in with their email and password.
    *   Upon successful authentication, the backend will generate two tokens:
        *   **Access Token**: A short-lived (e.g., 15-60 minutes) JWT containing user identity information (like `userId`, `role`) and permissions. This token is sent with each API request in the `Authorization` header (Bearer scheme).
        *   **Refresh Token**: A long-lived (e.g., 7-30 days) token stored securely (e.g., in an HTTP-only cookie for web clients or secure storage for mobile). This token is used to obtain a new access token when the current one expires, without requiring the user to log in again.
*   **Token Issuance and Validation**:
    *   The backend authentication service will be responsible for issuing and validating JWTs.
    *   Tokens will be signed using a strong secret key (HMAC, RSA, or ECDSA).
*   **Logout**:
    *   Client-side: Discard the access and refresh tokens.
    *   Server-side (optional but recommended for enhanced security): Implement a token blocklist or use a mechanism to invalidate refresh tokens upon logout.

### 2. Password Management

*   Passwords will be hashed using a strong, salted hashing algorithm (e.g., Argon2, bcrypt).
*   Password complexity rules will be enforced.
*   Secure password reset mechanisms (e.g., email verification) will be implemented.

## Data Protection

Protecting patient data is paramount. MedRouter will implement the following measures:

### 1. Encryption

*   **Encryption in Transit**:
    *   All communication between the client (frontend) and the backend server, and between backend services (including LLM APIs), will be encrypted using HTTPS/TLS (Transport Layer Security).
*   **Encryption at Rest**:
    *   Sensitive data stored in the database (e.g., patient health information, PII in user profiles, chat logs) will be encrypted at the field level or using full-disk encryption.
    *   Database credentials and API keys for LLMs will be stored securely using a secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or environment variables in a secure environment).

### 2. Access Control

*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: As defined in `user_roles_and_permissions.md`, users will only have access to data and functionalities relevant to their roles.
*   **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data will be collected and processed. Doctors will only access patient data for cases they are assigned to.

### 3. Audit Trails and Logging

*   Comprehensive audit logs will be maintained for significant events, such as:
    *   User login attempts (successful and failed).
    *   Access to patient records.
    *   Data creation, modification, or deletion.
    *   Report generation and access.
*   These logs will be stored securely and reviewed periodically.

### 4. Data Backup and Recovery

*   Regular automated backups of the database will be performed.
*   A data recovery plan will be in place to restore data in case of system failure or data loss.

### 5. Compliance (HIPAA & GDPR)

*   **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)**:
    *   Technical safeguards (encryption, access controls, audit trails) will be implemented as per HIPAA requirements.
    *   Administrative and physical safeguards will need to be addressed at an organizational level.
    *   Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) will be considered for third-party services handling PHI (Protected Health Information), including LLM providers if they process identifiable data.
*   **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**:
    *   Principles of data protection by design and by default will be followed.
    *   Mechanisms for data subject rights (access, rectification, erasure, portability) will be planned.
    *   A Data Protection Officer (DPO) might be required depending on the scale of data processing.
    *   Consent mechanisms for data processing will be clear and granular.

### 6. Secure Development Practices

*   Regular security code reviews.
*   Dependency scanning for known vulnerabilities.
*   Use of secure coding guidelines (e.g., OWASP Top 10).
*   Environment separation (development, staging, production).

## LLM Integration Security

*   **Local MedGemma (LMStudio)**:
    *   The LMStudio API endpoint will be secured and only accessible from the backend application.
    *   If running on a separate machine, network access controls (firewalls) will restrict access.
*   **Fine-tuned Mistral Model API**:
    *   API keys will be managed securely.
    *   Communication will be over HTTPS.
    *   Data sent to this API will be minimized to what's necessary for image analysis. The nature of data (identifiable or de-identified) sent to external LLMs needs careful consideration regarding HIPAA/GDPR.

This document provides a foundational plan. Specific implementation details will be refined during the development phase.
